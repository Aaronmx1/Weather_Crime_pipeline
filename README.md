# WeatherAPI_pipeline
Pipeline which retrieves weather data from open-meteo and loads ingested data into MariaDB

# Overview
3/11/2025 iteration: This is the initial phase of my data pipeline setup which consists of one table storing weather data from open-meteo's API.  The cities queried were Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego from the dates 1/1/2024 to 1/1/2025.  There were roughly 26k records retrieved and stored which I plan to build upon in order to generate a more complex schema that allows for additional analysis.
